# ReBookmark
Mac Automator Code to drive Chrome to bookmark series of files
The script is pretty simple.  You can dump any amount of text of any kind into the upper window. The script will pull out the URLs and then run them through Chrome and bookmark each one.
Future improvements could include testing to see if the page has loaded and also trapping certain errors. In addition, it might be nice to actually just read the current bookmark file and redo it while keeping the folder structure. 
However, this is a real quick and dirty solution to recreating a set of bookmarks so the newish Google Chrome Bookmark manager reinitializes the mark which will also create the thumbnail which is the entire reason for creating this in the first place.
